# Stocks_AI

this is a free to use free to contribute to stock prediction model

it is a LSTM 
The point of this is not to make the best stock predictor to get rich

it's too play and update an AI model to learn how to build one that is progressively better over time to understand
the architecture and the process it takes to build one that works at a high level

it's a sequential model 
with an adam optimizer
loss is mean squared error
the stocks i am using are apple, tesla, nvidia, amazon, meta

it attempts to make a next day prediction
i am going to add a next week prediction as well
